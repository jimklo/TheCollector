                    <label for="rating4">Quality of Technological Interactivity</label>
                    <p>Applies to objects that have a technology-based interactive component. Used to rate degree and quality of an object's interactivity. Interactivity broadly means that the object responds to the user - the object behaves differently based on what the user does. This is not a rating for technology in general, but for technological interactivity.</p>
