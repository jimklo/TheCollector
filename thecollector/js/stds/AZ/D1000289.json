[{"leaf":false,"text":"Concept 1: Research Skills for History<br />Historical research is a process in which students examine topics or questions related to historical studies and/or current issues. By using primary and secondary sources effectively students obtain accurate and relevant information. An understanding of chronological order is applied to the analysis of the interrelatedness of events. These performance objectives also appear in Strand 2: World History.
